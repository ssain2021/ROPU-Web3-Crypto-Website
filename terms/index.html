          <p>
           The material on this site is provided for general information only and is correct to the best of our knowledge. 
            It should not be relied upon or used as the sole basis for making decisions regarding your purchase or services on our website. 
            Any reliance on the material on this site is at your own risk. We reserve the right to modify the contents of this site at

        <div>
          <h4>PRODUCTS AND SERVICES</h4>
          <p>
            Certain products or services are exclusively available online through the RoboPuppy.world website.
          We may run a Discord server and a Telegram channel for information, promotion, and/or members' discussions. 
            Please note that we reserve the right to reject or ban any member infringing on our rules. 
            Purchasing our products does not confer the buyer any right of access to such Discord server and/or Telegram channel. 
            Characteristics of the products and services may be changed according to circumstances and we would consult 
            our community for this. </p>

            <p> All purchases of ROPU tokens during Presale are final and cannot be refunded. You can only trade at DEX or 
              CEX Exchanges after launching ROPU on DEX and/or CEX Exchanges.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>RESTRICTIONS</h4>
          <p> You may not purchase or use our products if you are in a country where Crypto Coin purchases are prohibited by law.
                      </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>TRADING ON SECONDARY MARKET</h4>
          <p>
            During the pre-sale period, our investors will not be able to sell, 
            trade, or transfer their RoboPuppy tokens until after the pre-sale has ended. At the end of pre-sale, the 
            RoboPuppy team will airdrop the Tokens to investors and unlock the trading of RoboPuppy on DEX (PanCakeSwap) Exchange
            to be freely sold, traded, or transferred. Once the RoboPuppy (ROPU) trading starts on DEX, the price of ROPU 
            on PanCakSwap or similar third-party platform(s) will be fixed by the market and may fluctuate up and down independently.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>STAKING</h4>
          <p>
          RoboPuppy token holders will be able stake their tokens (boost) on one or more staking contracts from RoboPuppy. 
            All the staked tokens will remain locked in Staking Wallet for the Staking duration.
         When Staking ends, Staked Tokens and Rewards will be sent to the Client's Wallet from where the
          tokens were sent for Staking. RoboPuppy token holders are solely responsible for all fees and costs 
            associated with staking their RoboPuppy tokens. All the costs and fees are collected in one of the crypto tokens 
            only, like, ROPU, USDT, or, BNB.
          </p>
